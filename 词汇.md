**sabotage**    **SYN** damage, destroy

**a share of population**

**mandatory retirement**

Labour-force participation for women of childbearing age also fell, **probably owing to** the increasing cost of child care.

**demographic dividend**

As a result, Chinaâ€™s labour force as a share of the total population was roughly stable, **hovering at** around 50%, from 1982 to 2015.

From 1982 to 2010, the share of people going to university **increased tenfold to 38%** for those with an urban *hukou*.

In rural areas, the **proportion who attained a basic level of education** more than doubled to nearly 60%.

By **moving rural workers into more productive jobs** in the cities, urbanisation probably also helped.

But if demographic changes were not a **critical driver** of gains in gdp per person the past, they may not be disastrous for the future.

These results suggest that the country **has other levers to pull to offset a dwindling workforce**.

It could **increase the retirement age**. Its urbanisation rate, at 64%, is still below that of advanced economies and has room to rise. Immigration, if China were to ever consider it, could **bolster the labour force** too.
